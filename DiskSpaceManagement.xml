<Description>
Automated disk space management for your media library.
</Description>
<Overview>
This plugin was created mainly for those who use the split-level feature in Unraid. Due to how split level works, it will ignore the minimum free space setting and continue to move stuff to disks that are full/almost full. This is because split level tries to keep files and folders that belong together based on your split level setting on the same disk, and split level trumps all other settings. Even if there's little space left on the disk. So to combat this, this plugin will automatically move Movies and TV shows from disks that are below the threshold setting to the disk with the most free space available. It prioritizes to move movies first, then if no movies are found it will go to TV shows and move the shows with the fewest seasons first.
